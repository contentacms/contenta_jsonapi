"Quick overview","<p>Contenta is an API-First distribution. If you are seeing this page, it means that you have installed the demo content for the distribution. After installing the demo content, you can start making requests right away.</p>
<h2 id=""json-api-server""><a name=""user-content-json-api-server"" href=""#json-api-server"" class=""headeranchor-link"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""headeranchor""></span></a>JSON API server</h2>
<p>Contenta ships with the <a href=""https://drupal.org/project/api"">JSON API</a> module to expose your data model and to start interacting with it right away. To get started use your favorite HTTP client and issue the following request:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
</code></pre>
<p>That will return you a list of resources you can explore. In particular, the <code>/api/recipes</code> resource will give you information about all the existing entities. Please read <a href=""https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/json-api/json-api"">the documentation in Drupal.org</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZOQ_ZMpYrZsyO-3IstImK1okrpfAjuMZ"">the video series in YouTube</a> to find out more about how to interact with the JSON API server.</p>

<h2 id=""oauth2-authentication""><a name=""user-content-oauth2-authentication"" href=""#oauth2-authentication"" class=""headeranchor-link"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""headeranchor""></span></a>OAuth2 Authentication</h2>
<p>Contenta enables OAuth2 authentication out of the box using the <a href=""https://drupal.org/project/simple_oauth"">Simple OAuth</a> module. It enables the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEKKFExaBMM&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLZOQ_ZMpYrZtqy5-o7KoDhM3n6M0duBjX"">password grant</a>, but it also comes configured with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6xlW7RsUUk&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLZOQ_ZMpYrZtqy5-o7KoDhM3n6M0duBjX"">client credentials</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khh8MmY9jm4&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLZOQ_ZMpYrZtqy5-o7KoDhM3n6M0duBjX"">authentication code</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZbzcCXMmEA&amp;index=9&amp;list=PLZOQ_ZMpYrZtqy5-o7KoDhM3n6M0duBjX"">implicit</a> grants.</p>
<p>Depending on the application you are building you will need one or another grant. You can use <a href=""http://oauth2.thephpleague.com/authorization-server/which-grant/"">this diagram</a> to decide which grant is the most appropriate for you.</p>
<h2 id=""automatic-data-model-documentation""><a name=""user-content-automatic-data-model-documentation"" href=""#automatic-data-model-documentation"" class=""headeranchor-link"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""headeranchor""></span></a>Automatic data model documentation</h2>
<p>One of the goals of Contenta is to allow front end developers to create amazing digital experiences. To help them Contenta ships with the <a href=""https://drupal.org/project/docson"">Docson</a> to expose automatically generated rich documentation of the API. Explore it now by going to <a href=""/docson"" title=""Docson schema selector"">the docson schema selector page</a>.",Kinnikuman,/quick-overview

"Welcome to Contenta CMS!","<div class=""card-panel""> <p>OK! I just installed Contenta CMS, now what?</p><p>First of all, congratulations! We know that trying new software can be both fun and also a little bit intimidating. In any case we are glad to see that you are giving this a shot.</p><p>From here there are two different paths you can follow next:</p><ul> <li>You can explore the capabilities of decoupled Drupal from the backend perspective.</li><li>You can revert the site to a clean state and remove all the demo content and configuration.</li></ul></div><div class=""card-panel""> <h2 id=""exploring-contenta-cms""><a name=""user-content-exploring-contenta-cms"" href=""#exploring-contenta-cms"" class=""headeranchor-link"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""headeranchor""></span></a><i class=""material-icons"">explore</i> Explore</h2> <p>The first two things you want to do are:</p><ol> <li>Go to the <a href=""/admin/structure/types"">content types configuration page</a> and explore the different content types and their fields to understand what you are going to be exposing.</li><li>Head over to the content list page to see the demo content that you can interact with.</li></ol></div><div class=""card-panel""><h2 id=""exploring-contenta-cms""><a name=""user-content-start-working"" href=""#start-working"" class=""headeranchor-link"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""headeranchor""></span></a><i class=""material-icons"">mode_edit</i> Start Working</h2><p>One of the first things that you may want to do is to understand what your API looks like. Read about <a href=""/understanding-api-schemas"">Understanding API Schemas</a> to know more.</p><p>Once you understand what is the schema of your API and what it will look like, is&rsquo;t time for you to start <a href=""/making-your-first-request"">Making Your First Request</a>.</p><p>The section about <a href=""/creating-content-using-the-api"">Creating Content Using the API</a> will give you information about how you can use the API to write content to Contenta, instead of just reading from it.</p><p>It is possible that you will need to make <a href=""/authenticated-requests"">Authenticated Requests</a>. That&rsquo;s fine too, we have you covered. Contenta comes with OAuth support out of the box.</p><p>Finally, if you are a perfectionist you will probably want to learn how to aggregate your requests for performance reasons. JSON API makes it really easy to have very few requests, however some times you just want <a href=""/one-request-to-rule-them-all"">One Request to Rule Them All</a>.</p></div><div class=""card-panel""><h2 id=""reverting-to-a-clean-state""><a name=""user-content-reverting-to-a-clean-state"" href=""#reverting-to-a-clean-state"" class=""headeranchor-link"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""headeranchor""></span></a><i class=""material-icons"">settings_backup_restore</i> Revert to a Clean State</h2><p>You have already explored what contenta can offer out of the box, now you are ready to start building your project.</p><p>In order to revert Contenta to a clean slate you will need to uninstall the <em>Recipes Magazin</em> and the <em>Recipes Magazin Contenta</em> modules. By uninstalling those modules you will:</p><ul> <li>Remove the demo content types: Recipe, Page and Article.</li><li>Remove the customizations to clean the API of Drupalisms.</li><li>Remove all the content for the demo content types. Even if you created the content after installing, if you remove the content types the content will be deleted.</li></ul><p>Once those two modules are gone, you will have a clean Contenta CMS installation. Even this page and all the help content will be gone.</p><p>If you ever regret this decision, it&rsquo;s OK! By re-enabling those two modules you will get everything back.</p></div>",Contenta team,/welcome
