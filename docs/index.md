# Contenta CMS

Contenta is an API-First Drupal distribution. It's all about the content. Learn more at [http://contentacms.org](http://contentacms.org).

## [](#goals)Goals
One of the conclusions of DrupalCon Baltimore was that Drupal 8 has **impressive tools to build a decoupled application**. However, assembling all the tools together and setting them up correctly can be a little bit daunting. On top of that, once you have everything set up you need to figure out the ins and outs of your front-end project.

With this in mind, Contenta CMS was born to _make your content happy_. Contenta CMS is the response of **the community** to build an API-First Drupal distribution. The goals of Contenta are simple: provide a standard platform that is API ready along with demo content and example front-end applications. In summary, Contenta intends to ease the pain of using, or simply trying, decoupled Drupal.

## [](#demos)Demos
An integral part of Contenta is to provide an out of the box content model and demo content ready for you to start working with it. The demo chosen by the community is a [recipe magazine](https://www.drupal.org/node/2818741).

With this in mind, every demo consumer will implement this recipe magazine site with the goal in mind to compare the different implementations.

### [](#example-front-ends)Example Consumers

Choosing your own front-end technology is one of common reasons to choose a decoupled approach. In a decoupled architecture you can also have multiple front-ends at the same time. Contenta gives you examples on how to build a consumer application in different technologies.

We will implement the [same wireframes](https://www.drupal.org/node/2818741#comment-12122841) as the Out of the Box Initiative, so all the demo applications can be compared. Even though all applications will have the same structure, each one will choose their look and feel. Angular may use [material design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html), elm may use [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), etc.
