# Contenta

## Requirements

- Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- Make sure you have the sqlite extension for PHP (if you're using the default install on a mac, this should already be there)
`sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3`

## Quick Install

```bash
php -r "readfile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/contentacms/contenta_jsonapi/8.x-1.x/installer.sh');" > contentacms.sh
chmod a+x contentacms.sh
./contentacms.sh
```

- To restart the webserver, run `composer run-script start-contenta <install location>`
- Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8888/](http://127.0.0.1:8888/) and log into your site with `admin`/`test`
- The host and port can be overridden by copying `.env` to `.env.local`

### CORS

When you actually build a frontend you will likely have [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)
issues.

In order to allow browsers to request the contenta backend you need to:

* Copy sites/default/default.services.yml to sites/default/services.yml
* Allow your app to access it, by replacing the end of this configuration file.
```
  cors.config:
    enabled: true
    allowedHeaders:
      - '*'
    allowedMethods:
      - '*'
    allowedOrigins:
       # Note: you need to specify the host + port where your app will run.
      - localhost:8000
    exposedHeaders: false
    maxAge: false
    supportsCredentials: false
```
* Run drush: ```cd web && ../bin/drush cr```

This work is based upon a couple of contrib modules.

On top of that the [thunder distrbution](http://www.thunder.org/) was used as sort of a base for this installation profile.
