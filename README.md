# Contenta

## Quick Install

```bash
php -r "readfile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/contentacms/contenta_jsonapi/8.x-1.x/installer.sh');" > contentacms.sh
chmod a+x contentacms.sh
./contentacms.sh
```

For this to work you will need to have composer installed in your local machine. See [get composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for more details. Also, make sure that the sqlite-extension is installed (`sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3` in debian/ubuntu).

## Installation

* [Get composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* Create a new project using a command like this. This will pull down the installation profile + core + modules, so maybe get a cup of tea:
```
composer create-project contentacms/contenta-jsonapi-project MYPROJECT --stability dev --no-interaction
```
* After that install Drupal normally.

### CORS

When you actually build a frontend you will likely have [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)
issues.

In order to allow browsers to request the contenta backend you need to:

* Copy sites/default/default.services.yml to sites/default/services.yml
* Allow your app to access it, by replacing the end of this configuration file.
```
  cors.config:
    enabled: true
    allowedHeaders:
      - '*'
    allowedMethods:
      - '*'
    allowedOrigins:
       # Note: you need to specify the host + port where your app will run.
      - localhost:8000
    exposedHeaders: false
    maxAge: false
    supportsCredentials: false
```
* Run drush: ```cd web && ../bin/drush rc```

## Credits

This work is based upon a couple of contrib modules.

On top of that the [thunder distrbution](http://www.thunder.org/) was used as sort of a base for this installation profile.

Contenta CMS is [built by humans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/contentacms/contenta_jsonapi/8.x-1.x/humans.txt).
